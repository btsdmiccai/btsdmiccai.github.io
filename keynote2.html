                <h3>Abstract</h3>
                <p>Data-driven methods are dominating the recent developments in artificial intelligence. When applied to medicine many challenges remain die to domain shift, lack of annotations, the needed amount of data, potential bias, etc. In this talk, I will discuss our current works on applying AI methodologies for multiple conditions drawn from eye care, cancer, pathology, geriatrics, autism, and stroke and how we address some of the challenges mentioned above.</p>
