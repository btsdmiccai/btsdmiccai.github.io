                <h3>Abstract</h3>
                <p>In this talk, I will begin by offering a brief overview of the evolution of artificial intelligence, highlighting its various peaks and valleys, and the current state of the field. I will argue for a shift in our focus from "Big Data for Small Tasks" to "Small Data for Big Tasks" in order to advance toward our ultimate goal of achieving human-level general intelligence. Following this, I will delve into our academic quest for a unifying theory of artificial intelligence, emphasizing the importance of incorporating social and physical commonsense into our research. Additionally, I will introduce a framework for analyzing the challenges of achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). This framework includes descriptive criteria of AGI and introduces two key components: a Comprehensive Cognitive Architecture and a Dynamic Environment with Physical and Social Interactions (DEPSI). Finally, I will outline the critical future research directions in the field that could pave the way for the next generation of AI.</p>
